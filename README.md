# 🧠 Psychotic

> **You're not crazy — you're just 100× away from being called a genius.**

Psychotic is a mindset, a framework, and a signal.
It lives at the edge where obsession becomes innovation, where ideas feel unstable—until they change everything.

## 🚀 What is Psychotic?

Psychotic is for builders, thinkers, and creators who:

* Think too far ahead
* Obsess over ideas others don’t understand (yet)
* Get called *crazy* before they get called *right*

History doesn’t remember the sane ones.

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

* **Madness is misunderstood focus**
* **Noise today, signal tomorrow**
* **If it scares people, you’re close**

Psychotic isn’t chaos — it’s uncompressed vision.

## 🔥 Why Psychotic?

Because every breakthrough started as:

* “That’ll never work”
* “You’re overthinking”
* “You’re insane”

Until it worked.

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

* Experimental products
* Radical ideas
* Frontier tech
* Art, code, or beliefs that don’t fit categories

If it feels unsafe, it’s probably interesting.

## 📐 Core Principle

> **Genius is just insanity that survived long enough.**

Psychotic exists to protect ideas before the world catches up.

## 🛠 Status

This is not finished.
It’s not stable.
It’s not meant to be.

Evolution is the feature.

## 🖤 Final Note

You’re not broken.
You’re early.

Welcome to **Psychotic**.
